Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to send you the final version of the PaNOSC Consortium Agreement for signature. Please print out the signature page of your institute in 7 copies, have these pages dated and signed by the authorised representatives of your institute, and return all 7 original signature pages to me at the address indicated below.

Once we have received all signatures, we will return one fully executed original copy of the Consortium Agreement to each party.

Thank you very much for your collaboration.

Kind regards,
Renata
