This was the 2nd meeting of WP2 on Data Policy and Stewardship.

Present:

    Florian (ELI), Gerd (PSI), Emiljana (LLB), Krysztof (EuXFEL), Jean-Francois (ILL), Jon (ESS), Dario (CERIC), Andy (ESRF)

The agenda was:

* Review of differences + similarities between Data Policies at each site

    The table of differences was reviewed but not completed. All members are invited to add their input (including observers). A column will be added to indicate which items we think need to be updated.

    A question was raised about how quickly should we open data and should subsets of data be opened to encourage opening dat sooner. What about data that the users have decided not to publish. Should they be opened earlier? How to encourage users to do so?

    The question of machine readable data was raised. What does it mean, how to include it in the data policy and how to implement it?
    

* Questions for FairsFair kickoff meeting

    The questions for the FAIRsFAIR meeting were reviewed. The questions can be found in this issue:

* GOFAIR initiative

    Andy and Jean-Francois mentioned they had been contacted by the GO-FAIR (https://www.go-fair.org/) office in France to setup a GO-FAIR initiative for photons and neutrons. It was not clear what the advantages of this initiative are compared to working with FAIRsFAIR and working inside PaNSOC. Jean-Francois thought the political aspect was important and needed to be evaluated. Andy said the EC has asked us to work with FAIRsFAIR. Krysztof said we must all go together if we go and not as individuals.

* AOB

    Gerd mentioned that PSI is conducting a survey of data policies as part of Calipsoplus.
