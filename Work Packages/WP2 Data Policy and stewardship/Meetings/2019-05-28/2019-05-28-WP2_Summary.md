* GDPR + EU-XFEL feedback (Krzysztof)

    Krzysztof presented the issue with GDPR at EU-XFEL. He said that their lawyer has asked them to introduce a privacy policy for the listing of author's names on the DOIs. In the meantime only the PI is listed. He asked if others had this issue or not. Neither the ILL nor the ESRF (the other two sites minting DOIs) had this issue.
    The issue will be followed as part of WP2 in the new data policy framework proposal.

* Proposal from CERIC (RP)

    Roby presented a propsoal he has made at CERIC to keep only useful data i.e. which are cited or downloaded in the archive. If data is not cited or downloaded for a certain number of years it will be removed from the archive.

* Data Policy framework

    Andy presented the proposal he and JOn are working on for writing a paper on the issues in data policies. This will be a kind of updated version of Brian Matthews paper from 2000 (?) on the icat data model. It will serve as foundation for the new data policy.

* AOB 

    Andy reported that they have published a paper on "ESRF Data Policy, Storage, and Services" in Synchrotron Radiation News:
