This is the 5th meeting of WP2 on Data Policy and Stewardship to be held 12/06/2019 at 13:30.

The agenda was:

* Lessons learned document (Dario + Andy) - please start editing document before

    Everyone was requested to fill in their lessons learned by the end of June 2019.
    Input required from all (except CERIC who has already filled it in).

* Feedback from EOSC meeting in Turin (Jean-Francois)

    Jean-Francois gave some feedback on Turin meeting which was not directly related to WP2 and Data Policy. He strongly encouraged PaNOSC to connect with the other cluster projects to discuss common approaches to data policy, and other topics in other WPs.

* Data Policy framework - next steps (Jon + Andy)

    There was not enough time to discuss this. No news about the framework paper proposed by Jon.

* AOB 

    Andy mentioned this paper from the EOSC-hub on data policy recommendations:

    https://documents.egi.eu/document/3419

    He asked if anyone had read it and if not could they take a look.
