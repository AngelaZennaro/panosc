PaNOSC wp 2 data policy
We need to deliver an update to the pan-data data policy that defines best practice for fair data in a framework that can be implemented (as a policy) by large scale facilities. 

For Fair to work there we should codify the requirements. 

Data types & actors.

Meta Data standards
    Suggested standards
        Should we revisit & update Core Scientific Metadata Model in Large-Scale Facilities Brian Mathews paper which is the only paper available that                    describes what is done. Its rather outdated and really only describes the RAL model with icat.
        We have to describe these as best practice - the cost to change could be high
    Alignment with journals & funding agencies - This is not going to be easy - the publishers do not have a clear interface for all areas of science.

How to make photon and neutron data data FAIR

    Introduction 
        What is fair
        What are the key benefits.
        For users 
        For facilities 
        For others, SMEs the public
        How should we interpret FAIR for photon and neutron research infrastructures.
        FAIR is so broad in its reach ‘full’ implementation maybe beyond reach 
        What is our ambition - what are the key requirements 
        What is the minimum viable product that can deliver the necessary requirements 
        What does open data mean for photon and neutron sources.
        What is the current land scape, current state of the art.
