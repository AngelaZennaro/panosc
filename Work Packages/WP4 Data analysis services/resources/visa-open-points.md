# VISA open points

|ID|Open point|
|--- |--- |
|1|Do we support multiple Linux distributions|
|2|Do we support windows and Mac-OS|
|3|Do we (if so how) support commercial software (eg Matlab)|
|4|How do we decide on the computing resources relevant to a proposal/instrument/experiment|
|5|How long do we keep machines running for? Test for user activity on the machine?|
|6|Do we hibernate machines|
|7|How do we support thousands (even hundreds) of concurrent users|
|8|Do we require quotas and queuing mechanisms. Accepted proposals are allocated N units of analysis time|
|9|Can we auto-scale a machine|
|10|How do stop abuse of resources (eg bitcoin mining, spamming, accessing local network/DBs, brute force attacks)|
|11|How do we quantify machine uses (CPU hours or real-time hours?)|
|12|Is there a payment model for people to access resources|
|13|Can an instrument responsible extend user quotas|
|14|Is the analysis performed on open data also open/public? Can someone see how I analysed my data after it is open|
|15|If we want to mint a DOI for data analysis (or environment), who is the DOI provider (the data curator (ILL, ESRF...) or a general PaNOSC one)|
|16|Can a facility allocate compute resources for data curated by another facility|
|17|Are machines institute-specific or do we have a pool of machines|
