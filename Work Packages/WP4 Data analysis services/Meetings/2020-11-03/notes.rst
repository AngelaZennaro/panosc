Task Forces (TF)
================

4 Task Forces has been proposed to foster closer communication between collaborating parteners.

- Scientific use cases and corresponding DA tools
This TF harmonises the panosc DA toolset which is driven by the local scientific needs at each facility. Which tool in which environment (Remote desktop and/or Jupyter) shall be provided/offered for specific use cases, experiment types, or specific datasets.

- Remote Desktop
This TF provides the know-how and helps each facility to integrate/configure Remote Desktop service into the inplementation of the local portal according to the local requirements.

- Jupyter
This TF provides the know-how and helps each facility to integrate/configure Jupyter service into the inplementation of the local portal according to the local requirements.

- Portal
This TF concentrates on the common development of the portal and its deployment at each facility. A frequent communication with WP3 and WP6 is foreseen.


We decided to meet on Friday again and clarify the TF objectives and define our next year plans. Note that instead of bi-weakly WP meetings, every second slot can be transformed into TF meetings.
