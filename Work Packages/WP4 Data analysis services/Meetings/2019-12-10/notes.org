#+TITLE: WP4 Video meeting <2019-12-10 Tue 15:00>

* KPIs
- KPIs are defined during Trieste meeting (https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services/Meetings/2019-11-04-Trieste/notes.org#kpis)
- They are
  - KPI1: Percentage of facilities offering JupyterHub or remote desktop for analysis
    services
  - KPI2: Number of unique users making use of JupyterHub or remote desktop for
    analysis services at partner facilities
  - KPI3: Number of “techniques” available through remote services

- We need to find the corresponding numbers from every facility from 
  - before the project started, i.e. month0 (=M0) and 
  - after the first year, i.e. on 30 November 2019, (=M12)
