An updated schedule draft is shown in in `demo-session.rst <demo-session.rst>`__.



1. Introduction, Hans, ~10 mins
-------------------------------

-  WP4 motivation

   -  data analysis extracts meaning from data
   -  essential and non-trivial process in Photon and Neutron science
   -  reproducibility of the process from raw data to publication
   -  enables re-use and more effective science

-  WP4 objectives

   -  provide data analysis together with data
   -  control and execute data analysis remotely
   -  enable better reproducibility and re-usability

-  Details are in reports
-  Focus on demonstrations today

   -  data portal (slide with image)
   -  Jupyter Notebook and remote Desktop as remote analysis
      infrastructures
   -  Remote simulation to support experiments
   -  Link to publications & Reproducibility
   -  sharing and linking with Expands
   -  tool provision

      -  HDF5 integration into the web
      -  contribute to generic tools

-  Summary: how does this help science today and in the future?

   -  facilities make it easier for users
   -  allows other scientists to take the work further
   -  how does this link with EOSC
   -  highlight shortcomings and challenges

      -  different scientific domains have different challenges
      -  data access
      -  central EOSC hosted portal

         -  architecture?

- Improvements:
	- Link to reproducibility crisis (Nature paper)
	- mention and explain Jupyter
	- list talks on last slide, with names of presenters
	- COVID19 makes this far more relevant
	- 
	- why do we need a domain specific portal:
	  - because people want to search in a way meaningful to their domain
	
	- why is remote access important for EOSC? Add one item on slide
	
	- time line
  


Context for each demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all demonstrations, it is important to explain:

-  where is the demonstration executed? (local laptop/computer, remote
   compute facility, cloud compute)
-  where is the software / script coming from that is executed?
-  where is the data located that is used?
-  say what is mocked and what isn't
-  [probably more]

We should have a consistent way of showing this (ideally graphically).
-> Jakub to coordinate visual designs. Speakers to send demo schematics to him.

2. Data portal, Jakub, ~10 mins
-------------------------------

Key points to cover:

-  portal
-  finding data
-  application to lasers in example

Details:

-  showcase portal user interface and user experience
-  browse the data catalog
-  basic filtering
-  select one example data set
-  particle in cell simulation
-  go to details page, then click on publication (?)
-  back to details page, launch notebook to modify parameter and update
   visualisation

- Improvements:
  - showing search is essential
  - focus on search and firing up analyis
    - analysis itself can be kept short, to avoid overlap with subsequent demos (Thomas V, Thomas K)

3. Simulation, Thomas, ~10 mins
-------------------------------

Key points to cover:

-  beam very expensive, produces lots of data (also expensive)
-  use simulation to prepare experiment, check feasibility, optimise
   experiment
-  across-facility example
-  explain quantities of data
-  can use simulation results to test and improve analysis processes
-  Example for Jupyter Notebook driven computation and analysis

Details:

-  show simulation execution in notebook
-  show analysis of simulated experiment in notebook
-  if possible, run on EGI provided Binder (would be nice link to EOSC),
   alternatively Maxwell would be okay

4. Towards FAIR with Reproducible paper, Robert, 10 mins
--------------------------------------------------------

Key points:

-  example starts from published results
-  compare figures from paper and re-computation
-  has been reproduced by somebody who is not an author with help of the
   author
-  enables re-usability
-  Jupyter Notebook example
-  improvement: if created at publication time, can create extra DOI for
   analysis

Details:

-  provide a little context for paper
-  show paper and figures in it
-  execute re-production of paper (on EGI binder?)
-  compare reproduced figures with published figures
-  comment on data situation: data set so small that it is embedded with
   software

Improvements:
-  show figure from paper and figure from notebook next to each other in slide

5. User provided reproducible publication, Thomas V, 10 mins
------------------------------------------------------------

Key points:

-  example of scientist who produced reproducible analysis out of her
   own initiative, and published this on GitHub
-  downloads data from ESRF catalog
-  Jupyter Notebook and GUI example

Details:

-  Describe the process (how many notebooks, and steps, â€¦)
-  show part of the process (one notebook, describe GUI interaction if
   required)
-  paper is nearly published
-  example for scientist pushing envelop of reproducibility ->
   re-usability

Improvements:

- explain what runs where, including Binder
- polish resource slide with Jakub's help
- mentions 'embargo period' - make sure Andy has explained this, or introduce it here

6. Remote Desktop, could come from Franz (STFC/ExPaNDS), 10 mins
----------------------------------------------------------------

Key points:

-  show case remote desktop as remote analysis technology
-  shows neutron example

Details:

-  neutrons and different remote analysis technology (?)

7. General purpose tools: HDF5 viewer, Axel, 10 mins
----------------------------------------------------

Key points:

-  general purpose
-  reading data from HDF5 web server
-  contribute to wider community (beyond Photon and Neutron Science)

Details:

-  introduce HDF5 briefly, and comment on wide spread use
-  HDF5 viewer demo
-  dissemination plans (open source)
-  show or report on (plans for) integration with JupyterLab

Overall timings
===============

-  assume 90 minute slot in total
-  currently 7 presentations -> 20 minutes spare

   -  2 additional minutes questions per presentation, so we can fill a
      90 minute slot.
