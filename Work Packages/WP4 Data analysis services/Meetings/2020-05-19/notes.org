* Towards a HDF5 web viewer (Thomas V/Loic/Axel)
** URLs

- HSDS: a backend solution to serve HDF5 files; Repository: https://github.com/HDFGroup/hsds
- h5web: Repository: https://github.com/silx-kit/h5web, Demo: https://h5web.panosc.eu/

** Thomas V: general idea and objectives
- be able to visualise parts of the data without downloading whole files
- use NeXuS metadata for error bars, axis labels
- be as fast as possible through the web
- allow interaction on top of image
  - region of interest
  - mask
- create library that can be embedded in other applications
  - at ESRF more web-based interface to control and acquisition 
- make functionality available in Jupyter

** Loic: Backend - a short presentation of HSDS: a backend solution to serve HDF5 files.
- scenario: 
  - have hdf5 file on server
  - user is interested in parts of the file
  - return that data to user
- some related python tools
  - hdf5-simple-server (MAX-IV)
  - h5serv, HSDS
  - jupyterlab-hdf5
- chosen HSDS:
  - solution supported by HDF5 group
    - maintained
    - open source
    - performant
    - written in Python 3
- HSDS uses h5serv API: REST and JSON based
  - GET: read parts of the file
  - PUT/POST: write in the file
  - DELETE: remove files from the file
- HSDS can serve local files
- distributed architecture

** Axel: demo front end

Future work:
- deploy HSDS server
- more visualisation:
  - higher dimensional matrix
  - scatter plots
  - NeXuS support
- make components extractable and re-usable in JupyterNotebooks


* Next WP4 meeting
- 2 June 2020, 15:00
- Robert: Spack to manage computational environments

* Any other business

* Actions
- Robert and Lottie to circulate final versions / links to documents
- All: review reports to ensure they are happy with this (deadline: end of this
