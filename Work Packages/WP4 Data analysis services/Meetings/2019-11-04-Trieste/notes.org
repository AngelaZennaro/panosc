*** Onedata
- Spaces: virtual volume
- space can be shared by different people
- oneprovider is the software for one-data
- onezone - authentication and authorization
  - already set up for PaNOSC

- data access via web or REST API
*** PyFilesystem
- only for Python
- supports now onedata amongst many other 'file systems'

*** Notebook configuration
- use gitub/EGI-Foundation/notebooks/Issues to request extra packages

** Wed 10:30 Architecture outline (Jamie)
** Wed 11:00 reproducible science studies (Robert, Vincent) and discussion

** Interaction with WP3 and WP6, Wednesday 14:00-15:30
 https://indico.esrf.fr/indico/event/36/timetable/#20191106.detailed

Discussion:
- Tobias: who decides which computational resource is started? WP3 or WP4?
- Alun: how do you know about the computational resources that are available?

** Interactions with WP8 Training, Wednesday 16:00 - 17:00

- http://e-neutrons.org
- can use notebooks
- simulation based data generation and analysis are options
  (for most common use cases)
- List of existing training materials on Github
- training topics
  - physics
  - analysis methods
  - analysis tools
  - Jupyter?
  - FAIR
  - best practice for FAIR?
  - interactive documentation/tutorials
- target groups:
  - students
  - users
  - staff (beamline scientists)


* <2019-11-07 Thu>
** 9:00 Franz Lang (STFC) :“Update on a Data Analysis as a Service platform"
in the process of being rolled out at ISIS” and to cover: A brief
overview of what it is and where it is at in the rollout process.

- isis.analysis.stfc.ac.uk


** 9:30 Carlos: HDF5 viewer demo

Discussion
- hd5 viewer of wider interest
- new ESRF recruit may be able to lead the unification of this

IPyWidgets
- what is missing?
  - masking tool


** REANA
- platform similar to PaNOSC vision for particle physics
- Robert to send paper around.

* Questions and issues for WP4 (in unscheduled time)

** KPIs
- what KPIs have we got?
- how can we take a measurement?

KPIs discussed so far:
- Percentage of facilities offering JupyterHub or remote desktop for
  analysis services
- Number of unique users making use of JupyterHub or remote desktop for
  analysis services at partner facilities
- Number of "techniques" available through remote services

Required data

- Their values before PaNOSC (they may be zero in some cases)
- Their values on Y1 of PaNOSC (so at 30th November 2019)
- Their values on each subsequent anniversary of PaNOSC
- Target values for when the project finishes on Y4 (Optional)

** PaN Software catalogue
- https://software.pan-data.eu
- work planned on this in WP6
- do we know about it and engage with it?

** What training for WP4?
- work with WP8
- training in
  - Jupyter?
  - facility specific training?
  - Nexus files?

- who is the target audience?
  - panosc staff?
  - facility staff (beamline scientists)
  - users?
  - other? (Public?)

** Reproducible data sets and publications
- Useful example for reproducible data set
    https://github.com/alessaan/rhapsody-in-blue
- need to work with scientists


** Portal for March 2020
- deploy locally
- who can do it? what help is needed?

** Next meeting
- when?
- where?
- who?

** Joint updating of internal milestones
https://github.com/orgs/panosc-eu/projects/2

** Actions
- Develop best pracitce guidelines for reproducible publications
  - example ESRF (and SCS/MID@EuXFEL)
  -> training

- Person in charge of authentication should be in touch with WP6. Who
  is this for each facility?
