#+TITLE: WP4 Video meeting <2019-10-22 Tue 15:00>


* Report from internal milestone activities

Each contribution <= 2 minutes

- internal milestone 1: Oct 2019 Sample jupyter notebooks  (Thomas+Robert)
  - slight delay
  - not sure every facility has created a reproducible use case
  - should prepare place where each facility puts one such use case
  - for ESRF:
    - tutorials are good starting point: data is small, analysis is there
    - first 'real' use case based on notebooks
      - 17 notebooks, starting from some GigaBytes, spectroscopy, pyMCA?
    This two-step approach maybe useful for other sites as well.
    - Present example in Trieste

- internal milestone 2: Nov 2019 User interface design (portal),
  (Jakub + Gareth + Stuart + Jamie)
  - slight delay
  - initial discussions with Jamie and Stuart
  - technologies: react
  - Should discuss more in Trieste

- internal milestone 3: Feb 2020 Architecture selection of required
  technologies and specification (Stuart+Eduard+Aidan)
  - [Jamie]
  - Meeting with ESRF about portal development
  - suggest to bring milestone forward
  - expect to start full time development in 2 weeks
  - hope to have minimal prototype by March 2020
    - login
    - create notebook / remote desktop
  - documents on confluence
  - multiple iterations

- internal milestone 4: Mar 2020 Compute resources API specification
  (Stuart+Jamie)
  - propose to remove this; it is part of internal milestone 3

- internal milestone 5: Jun 2020 Sample Remote desktop with local data
  (Stuart + Jamie, VISA)
  - propose to remove this - it is part of the iterative design and
    implementation

- internal milestone 6: Jun 2020 Sample Jupyter Notebooks execute in
  BinderEnvironment with local data (Robert+Thomas)
  - Robert: thinking about Singularity; create Singularity spawner for
    JupyterHub
  - Thomas: consider replacing kubernetis with Slurm
    - nbnovnc?

- internal milestone 7: Oct 2020 Prototype implementation for portal
  (Carlos + Eduard + Jamie)
  - contribute to internal milestone 3

- internal milestone 8: February 2021 Sample Jupyter Notebooks execute
  in BinderEnvironment with remote data (Thomas+Robert+Jamie)

- internal milestone 9: Use API from WP3 for Portal (Jamie)
  - Need metadata catalog to be searchable at this point -> align with WP3
  - WP3 demonstrator: scheduled for March 2021

- internal milestone 10: Nov 2021 Demonstrator prototype completed
  (Eduard + Robert + Jamie + Thomas)

- internal milestone 11: Nov 2021 First iteration of
  Documentation/Training materials (Kareem + Thomas) [Python training
  in Jupyter, particular analysis for selected analysis types, …]

- internal milestone 12: May 2021, Obtained user feedback after beta
  testing / validation (Thomas)

* Introduction reproducible science data study (Thomas Vincent)
-> Trieste
- when downloading data (from somewhere), it is important to be able
  to download only the parts we need
