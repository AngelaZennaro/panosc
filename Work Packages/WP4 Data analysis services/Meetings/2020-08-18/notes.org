#+TITLE: WP4 Video meeting <2020-08-18 Tue 15:00>

:present:  Jakub, Aidan, Franz (ISIS), Thomas K, Loic, Robert R, Matteo (Elettra), Hans

:apologies: Jamie, Lottie


* Welcome after summer break (round table)
From each facility
- brief update on COVID19 situation at facility
- any PaNOSC work highlights 

** ESS (report by email)
Re: Covid 19, we are working from home mainly, but will be back working 2 days a
week at the office from September onwards - I don't think we are blocked on any
panosc work.

Re: PaNOSC WP4 work, we have been working on deploying the panosc portal into
our infrastructure, rather than running it locally.

** ELI
- no lock down
- worked with deploying the portal
- learning about setting up HPC infrastructures
- also work on the portal

** EuXFEL
- COVID19: working from home, but public life is not very constraint
- PaNOSC: mostly working on OSCOVIDA, Deploy Spack at EuXFEL

** ESRF
- COVID19: back to work 2 days a week, rest of the week at home
- PaNOSC: JupyterHub on HPC in production, and is public, no progress on portal

** Elettra
- COVID: mostly smartworking from home, expect to be back in office in September

** Diamond (Chris)
- COVID: working from home
- PaNOSC

** ISIS (Franz)
- COVID: working remotely, no change expected
- expect graduate student to join ExPaNDS

* Technical coordination workshop announcement (Jamie/Daniel)
- proposed date for the workshop is October 8th 2020, from 13:00 to 17:00. 
- More details on the event is available here:
  https://indico.cells.es/event/249/
- all PaNOSC partners should present and participate

* Update on Portal front end development (Jakub and Jiri)
- Update on current state: technologies + structure
- Questions and challenges
- Search
- Integration with backend
- Original Analysis
- Development roadmap

*** Milestones
- October 2020 : prototype implementation for portal
  - well-organised, reusable UI components
  - prototype integration with search API
  - prototype integration with backend services
  - development and implementation of advanced search and filtering, 
  - and user dash board
- March 2021: Launch remote Desktop and Jupyter Analysis from portal
- November 2021 - Demonstrator prototype completed

** Discussion
*** Integration with backend services
- multi-dataset environment?
- single data per environment only?

Hans
- expect single dataset to be a very common use case
- bundling might be relatively irrelevant for EuXFEL (and some other facilities)
  as data is mounted anyway
- Aidan: calipso plus mounts the data sets (not built into container)
- Chris: similar situation at Diamond (for JupyterHub)

*** How to implement original analysis + original environment?
- additional button?
- default choice?

Hans:
  - 'original analysis' same as 'reproducible papers' we discussed before
  - good as example data set entries providing a set of:
    - data set, analysis code, (correct or at least known) analysis result
  - the reference data sets that ExPaNDS is gathering could also form a data set each in the system

*** Feedback
- double task for ELI: implementation and design at the same time
- good to raise questions and doubts

* Next steps for portal and user engagement (all)
- involvement of all sites in portal development
- user engagement

** Discussion
- implementation efforts trigger good questions
- iterate between back-end and front-end
- involve everybody in design questions


- Aidan: identify sys-admins and developers to see how to distribute tasks
- general agreement that we need to allocate tasks according to the expertise
  available at the partner sites

Hans:
- we must offer the portal at each facility as a local service, which 
  provides features that go beyond the current facility provision to make it attractive.
- What would scientists like?

Chris:
- we can make educated guesses, but we should get input from the scientists
- should drag in a bunch of scientists
- focus on those doing work in multiple facilities

Jakub:
- imagine public version of the portal as a prototype and ask scientists for feedback
Hans: 
- invite users to portal forum to (i) present current plans and invite feedback
  and (ii) ask them to demo what they are currently doing
- as an incentive, the local PaNOSC/ExPaNDS team that attracted the user, can
  turn their analysis requirements into a service that is supported [if
  possible].


** Portal forum
Suggestion to have a portal forum (suggestions for better names welcome!) that:
- is a group with at least one representative from all sites (PaNOSC and ExPaNDS)
- which discusses and develops the design for the portal (and associated back-end)
- feeds in requirements (probably based on the requirements for each facility)
- helps bring in users to advise on their requirements/wishlist

* Next meeting
Tuesday 8 September 15:00

* Any other business
- Reply to email with subject "Re: Block the dates / PaNOSC-ExPaNDS 2020 Annual
  Meeting / 9-11 November 2020"



* Actions
- each facility to nominate representative for portal forum (and a deputy)
