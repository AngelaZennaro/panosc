Manzi (EGI), Jakub Jiri (ELI) Kareem (ESS) Robert (ELI-Alps), Sandor, Franz Lang
(STFC), Aidan


* Actions from last meeting (Hans)
- Robert, Jakub and Jamie to work on internal Milestone
- Hans to suggest meeting dates with Anton/Expands
  - 11 to 14 May 2020
  
- All: contribute example data sets and analysis as hard-coded data examples for
  protoype.
  - EuXFEL: https://github.com/European-XFEL-examples
  - others? https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services ?

* Upcoming Code Camp (Thomas V -> Axel)
24-27 March, ESRF, ILL, https://indico.esrf.fr/indico/event/43/


- Expect up to 20 participants
- work on portal architecture
- work on infrastructure and deployment

Objective: 
- enable each facility to be able to install the portal


* Update from Portal (Jakub, Jamie)

- Documentation available at https://confluence.panosc.eu/display/wp4/Development 
- presentations https://confluence.panosc.eu/display/wp4/Presentations

- repositories are emerging on panosc github
- waiting  for feedback from people who try the employment
- aiming towards core-services ready by 27 March

- Have notebook integrated in 'app'
  - complicated (Axel)

- feedback from WP4 ExPaNDS meeting

* Welcome to Loic
- hdf5 viewer, visualisation, physicist by training
 
* Update Deliverable 4.2 (Lottie and team)
  - "Deliverable 4.2. Prototype remote desktop and Jupyter service (M18, DEM,
    CO, ILL)"

- use review from last deliverable with some extra questions to draft the report
  from
- need facilities to respond

* Preparation of review meeting (Hans)
- Probably second half of June

- WP3 - shows one MDC connnected to API
- Portal in current state
- Take a data set and show some data set 
 
* Presentation at review meeting (Robert R, Juncheng, Thomas K)

Robert: 
- Show XGM example to demonstrate reproducibility and re-usability 
- Other examples: 
  - Simulation based example (Juncheng?)

Discussion
- Andy: paint example
- Should involve EGI
  - use their binder?
- Andrea Manzi (EGI): Meeting on Friday, will

- Prototype remote desktop?
  -> ILL?
      
- Juncheng:
  - lisozyme data, could be simulated and compared with real data
  - Neutron simulation: McStas (ESS), but no experimental 
    data at the moment

Andy: 
  - Simulating coronavirus??

- what linked up demo (Juncheng, Thomas K)?
    - Thomas Holm Rod suggested in video meeting 
      - neutron analysis where we have simulation and experiment data
      - analyse that
    - Juncheng and Thomas K to explore

    - Mcstas - neutron simulation tool 
      - Mads (ESS)

- Action: develop Story boards of what could be shown for next meeting
  - These should be short descriptions of what could be shown
  - try to provide the context (what do we show: the portal, some analysis
    procedure, finding data through the portal, simulation, reproducible science
    example, ...)
  - what resources/infrastructure would be needed/could be used
  - don't be too detailed; initially we just need this to fine tune what we will
    present
  - content wise, we need to cover the following:
    - remote desktop analysis services (we have a deliverable for this),
      this would be remote data analysis in notebook or virtual machine
    - the PaNOSC vision and work started (portal, EGI integration)
    - ?
  
    - We expect storyboard on the topics that have been discussed from
    - Robert
    - Juncheng
    - Thomas K
    - Thomas V (Blue paint)
    - Jakub / Science story
    - Jakub / Portal / user interface
  - If there are no confidentiality issues, please add storyboards to 
    [[../2020-06-review-meeting/storyboards.md][this document]]
