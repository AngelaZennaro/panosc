[[https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services/Meetings/2020-03-24/notes.org][Minutes from last meeting]]

* Actions from last meeting
- Follow up from Portal discusions / SLURM support (see item below)
- Story boards for review meeting (see item below)
- Test deployment of portal prototype on production hardware (see item below)

* Deliverable D4.2 (Lottie)
- Deliverable 4.2. Prototype remote desktop and Jupyter service (M18, DEM, CO, ILL)
- Update from Lottie
  - most use cases for JupyterHub are there
    - ILL and EuXFEL available from the outside
  - waiting for remote Desktop use cases

* Portal architecture and prototype discussion - updates

** Development  
- slowed down at ILL due to lock down
- William is working on the deployment
- ELI working on front-end

** Slurm support (Robert)
- Robert sent survey around to gather requirements for SLURM backend
- ESRF, CERIC-ERIC, ELETTRA have replied to survey

** Deploy portal prototype on production hardware / with production teams
Any additional feedback already?

** Feedback from Management meeting
Look out for similar technologies emerging in other projects.

- REANA?
  - workflows with workflow languages
  - similar concept so that computation can be done on different cloud provides / SLURM
  - meeting with REANA develpoment team is planned
  - People interested to join the REANA video meeting, please contact Robert.

* 18 month Review meeting
** Context (Hans)
- Video meeting instead of in-person meeting
- Meeting is on 16 June, all day
- We'll have a rehearsal, about a week earlier
- Programme Management Committee starts to plan this
  (https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP1%20Management/Meetings/Project%20Management%20Committee/2020-04-08-PMC_ReviewMeeting/2020-04-08-PMC_Meeting.md)

- What are our objectives:
  - Support deliverable 4.2 - show demonstrations of remote data analysis
  - Demonstrate vision for PaNOSC data access and analysis 
    - this is okay if full of mock-ups

- Also extrapolate to link to EOSC:
  - what would the users get as a service once EOSC is running

- would be good in periodic report.

** WP4 contributions (Thomas K, Thomas V, Robert, Jakub, ...)
- Storyboards at https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services/Meetings/2020-06-review-meeting/storyboards.md
  - Story outlines (ideas where discussed [[https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services/Meetings/2020-02-25/notes.org#presentation-at-review-meeting-robert-r-juncheng-thomas-k][here]])

*** Robert: reproducible paper / Making FAIR data reality
- Binder-based reproduction of XGM paper
  - idea: maybe show reproduced figures in README of repo
- been taken to PaNOSC branded version of Binder / Portal?
  - paper is in the github repository
- data-access is a mock-up only
- Andy to ask EGI to set up Binder instance that could be used here.

*** Thomas Kluyver: simulated serial crystallography
- with Juncheng 
- couple crystallograpy simulation pipeline
- with data analysis (CrystFEL) to show we can go (nearly) full circle
  - from protein structure, to cell dimensions of macrocell
- simple version exists, need polishing.

- What resources do you need to do the simulation?
  - don't need to simulate a massive amount of data

- Anton: good idea to simulate experiment before it is conducted.

*** Thomas Vincent: Paint example
- using MyBinder
- data is downloaded in the beginning of the notebook
- a number of notebooks, one to create one figures
- remote desktop within the Jupyter environment
  - Jupyter-Desktop-Server
- will be showcased in 'advances in science' end of the month

*** Jakub
- showcase portal user interface and user experience
- browse the data catalogue
- basic filtering
- select one example data set
  - particle in cell simulation
- go to details page, then click on to publication
- back to details page, launch notebook to modify parameter and update
  visualisation

*** VISA demo
- Jamie to investigate

*** Remote Desktop could come from Franz (STFC/ExPaNDS)
Anton: 
- ExPands may have more examples suitable to remote Desktop because of the
  legacy software

*** Axel: HDF5 demo
- to be prepared

*** Discussion
- for each demo, we need explanation of 
  - where the data is, where the code is, where the code runs
    -> graphical overview, best consistent across multiple talks
- need to give overall concept in the beginning (-> Andy)

For selection of presentations and fine tuning:
- What are the unique points we are bringing across?
- what do we need to cover
- how much time have we got
-> for Andy and Hans to take forwarded initially

* Coronavirus data analysis (Hans)
- Hans (and Robert and David from EuXFEL) have drafted some data analysis of infection spread 
  (https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020)
- Interesting aspects:
  - source and data available for all plots
  - can be executed in Binder
  - local plots for Germany (could be extended to other countries)
- Should we use this as an example activity of PaNOSC Open Science activity for data analysis in the cloud?

* Update from HDF5 at ESRF (Axel)
- demo has moved to https://h5web.netlify.app
- heatmap

* Next meeting
21 April 2020, 15:00

* Any other business

* Actions
- Jamie/ILL: provide input to Lottie for D4.2 report
- ILL, ESS, CERIC-ERIC to reply to Robert's survey on Slurm
- Jamie/ILL: find aremote Desktop demo
- Axel: prepare hdf5-tool demo
- Hans & Andy: review suggestions for presentations
- People potentially interested to support the coronavirus plots, please get in
  touch with Hans
