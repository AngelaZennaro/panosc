- Update from Lottie

* Portal architecture and prototype discussion - updates

** Context
1. The portal deployment at your institute. Installation documentation can be
   found here: https://github.com/panosc-portal/panosc-portal-demo-deployment

2. The common portal design. The documentation can be found here:
   https://confluence.panosc.eu/x/lwCm 

The written summaries are available at https://confluence.panosc.eu/x/cIAVAQ

** Slurm support (Robert)

** Deploy portal prototype on production hardware / with production teams
Any additional feedback already?

** Feedback from Management meeting
Look out for similar technologies emerging in other projects.

* Review meeting
** Context (Hans)
- Video meeting instead of in-person meeting
- Meeting is on 16 June, all day
- We'll have a rehearsal, about a week earlier
- Programme Management Committee starts to plan this
  (https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP1%20Management/Meetings/Project%20Management%20Committee/2020-04-08-PMC_ReviewMeeting/2020-04-08-PMC_Meeting.md)

- What are our objectives:
  - Support deliverable 4.2 - show demonstrations of remote data analysis
  - Demonstrate vision for PaNOSC data access and analysis 
    - this is okay if full of mock-ups

** WP4 contributions (Thomas K, Thomas V, Robert, Jakub, ...)
- Storyboards at https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP4%20Data%20analysis%20services/Meetings/2020-06-review-meeting/storyboards.md

    - Jakub: Science story
    - Jakub: Portal / user interface
    - Robert: reproducible paper
    - Robert: new analysis on existing data
    - ILL: Remote Desktop example
    - ? : Demo remote analysis using Jupyter Notebook 

* Coronavirus data analysis (Hans)
- Hans (and Robert and David from EuXFEL) have drafted some data analysis of infection spread 
  (https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020)
- Interesting aspects:
  - source and data available for all plots
  - can be executed in Binder
  - local plots for Germany (could be extended to other countries)
- Should we use this as an example activity of PaNOSC Open Science activity for data analysis in the cloud?

* Update from HDF5 at ESRF (Axel)

* Next meeting
21 April 2020, 15:00
