* Spack to manage computational environments (Robert)

"Managing HPC Software Complexity with Spack"
- slides from Spack consortium

Why use Spack?
- Exascale Computing Project (ECP)
- built software from source
- can have local mirror of all sources (i.e. still works if source disappears from Internet, or if the Internet disappears itself)
  - good for reproducibility
- can install multiple versions of the same software but with different libraries/dependencies/flags
- can create containers from Spack
- can create module files Spack

* Next meeting
- 16 June: Cancelled due to review day.
- 30 June (probably)

* Any other business
