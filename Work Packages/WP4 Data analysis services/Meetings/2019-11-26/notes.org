** Summary of survey results
- different technology at every site
- containers are popular [also singularity]
- authentication is different across sites (move towards keycloak)
- all have data policy (pretty much?)
- hdf5 and nexus widely used (apart from EuXFEL)
- DOI: everyone using it (apart from ELI) using data cite 
- user portals exist where users exist
- most sites have jupyter Hub, set up in different ways
- Most HPC clusters use Slurm (apart from ILL, using torque)
  - no containers on clusters so far 
- root access for users to remove virtual machines: No

** Best practice and tools
 - git, gitlab
 - hdf5
 - remote analysis capability (apart from ELI)
 - jupyter 
 - containers
** EOSC integration
 - Authentication, data access, data shipping, allocation of computed 
   resources
 - each site hosts their services internally, for EOSC need to share those
   through EOSC

** Pilot data analysis services 
 - Jupyter, VISA
 - portal to link data with analysis services
 - populate reproducible example data sets
 - attempt to run portal locally 

* Discussion
STFC very happy share experience from the ISIS data analysis as a service
(IDAaaS) framework.

* Report from reproducible science data and analysis sets (Thomas Vincent/Robert)

* (Time permitting:) Update from Portal (Jamie/Stuart/?)
