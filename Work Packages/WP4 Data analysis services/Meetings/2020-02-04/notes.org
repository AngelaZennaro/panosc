- ELI: design-sketch/mock-up of interface
- ILL: outline prototype status, direction and anticipated deadlines
- Scope for contributions?

** Presentation Jakub / Jiri
*** Walkthrough of mock-ups
- searchable data sets shown on the left
- filtered results on the right, or all data sets shown
- search possibility at the top
- once logged in, display messages, own data sets, running sessions on the right
- once clicked on a specific data set
  - explore data set details with a preview
  - keep minimal 
- ELI focussed on front-end
- Objectives
  - user-friendly
  - fast & lightweight
  - easily extendable
  - data driven
  - minimalist UI, ligth and dark themes
  - use widely adopted framework (re-act)
- Architecture / prototype (Jiri)
  - have demo data for prototype
  - super minimal filtering
- Demo
  - who defines categories for filters?
  - prototype of the detail page
  - inspired by CERN and NASA data portal
  - feedback requested
- Discussion
  - Filters and experiment categories -> WP3 is working on these
  
** Presentation Jamie (and team)
- Focus on backend of portal
- Notebook service:
  - integrate notebook components "into the portal"
    - nice and centralised
- Assumptions about file locations?
- 27 March deadline to get core services developed
  - focus on basic functionality
- By end of March, it should be possible to install microservices 
  - it is easy when you have kubernetes running (helm ...)

- code on https://github.com/panosc-portal

- plan for later iteration to integrate the data

- mock data server?
  - yes
  - could serve reproducible data sets being collected 
    - this will provide analysis routines that could be fired up from the portal
      in a later iteration

- Objective for now
  - for each institute to create container / notebook and access it
- Objective for later
  - worry about integration of data

Discussion

- What if you haven't got a kubernetes cluster?
  - install kubernetes (could be in a container, doesn't need a strong machine
    at this point)
  - need private registry

- Requested feedback
  - feedback on the back-end
  
- When demo is ready to be deployed at facilities, Jamie and team will send an
  email, about two weeks from now. (TODO)
 
* Next Deliverable (April 2020)
  - Request from Management to move this from month 18 to month 16.5
    Having started in December 2018, Month 16.5 should be middle of April

  - "Deliverable 4.2. Prototype remote desktop and Jupyter service (M18, DEM,
    CO, ILL)"
    
  - ESS will lead this, please support them.

  - some demonstration at review meeting

* Next meeting
** Video meeting
- Tuesday 25th February 15:00 (then again two-weekly)

** In person meeting
