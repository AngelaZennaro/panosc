#+TITLE: WP4 video conference 2 July 2019

:present: Jamie (ILL), Carlos (CERIC-ERIC), Robert Ra (ELI), Jakub (ELI), Robert Ro (EuXFEL), Hans (EuxFEL)

* Introduction to Confluence (Jamie)

- projects are 'spaces'
- we have a 'wp4' space
- real-time editing of documents
- drawio can draw diagrams with history
- previews of pdf / powerpoint / word documents etc inside confluence
- Comments with @colleague notifications supported
- doesn't do repositories
- most powerful thing are the macros
- notifications are sent if items (documents) are modified

- How about issues?
  - could use JIRA if our demands outgrow capabilities of github issues

* Any other business
- workshop last week was received as useful and effective

* Summary from discussion
- put more complicated documents into Confluence
  - such as API specifications
- keep Confluence WP4 space world-readable (for transparency)
- stick to github issues for managing tasks
  - do this in our WP4 repository to separate issues:
  - https://github.com/panosc-eu/wp4
- use github as the main point of reference
  - every document in confluence needs to be referenced from github
- track activity through gitub issues so that we are aware what is
  happening at other sites (ALL)
- Carry on using Slack
