# Joint plans for WP4, 5 & 8

## Introduction

This document describes the joint plans for WP4, 5 & 8, where:

* WP4 concerns the development of infrastructure for data analysis services
* WP5 concerns the development of instrument simulation services
* WP8 concerns staff and user training including the development of an e-learning platform.

As mentioned WP8 focuses on staff and user training for the scope considered in PaNOSC as part of this goal, WP8 will also 
continue the development of e-neutrons.org, which will form the basis for the e-learning platform to be used for PaNOSC. The
scope of the development is three-fold:
1. Continue the development with sustainability in mind and integrate the functionality of Jupyter technology
2. Extend e-neutrons.org to cater for all scientific disciplines considered in PaNOSC (i.e. both the photon and 
   neutron sciences)
3. In the context of PaNOSC, develop courses for the e-learning platform.
