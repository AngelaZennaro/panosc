## Minutes

Thomas to continue drafting 
[plan in github repo](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/WP4-5-8/JointPlans.md).
Should link to first task in WP5, which can be broken down into smaller tasks which then can be linked to WP8 when appropriate. 

Immediate focus will be on McStas and McXtrace and then moving on to simex, which currently has some issues on platforms other 
than those it was developed for, and then OASYS to the extent it is possible. A milestone should be included with a decision on
OASYS.

Carsten intends to start bi-weekly meetings for WP5

Major challenge with e-learning platform is integration of Jupyter technology where there apparently does not currently exist 
a ready-to-use solution. Once this has been solved, it will be easier to leverage the outcome from the first task in WP5 (APIs).
