Minutes

Florian presented the objectives and schedule for the annual meeting. The plan is to have 20 mins presentation followed by 20 mins discussion for each ExPaNDS/PaNOSC WP. In the joint session for WP5/WP8 we should present
1. Progress
1. Dependencies on other work packages
1. Plans for engagement with users
1. Roadmap 

### 1. Progress

We should present what has been done in each project and jointly. The WP leaders should draft some slides for this

#### PaNOSC
Present what has been don on pan-learning.org
* Jupyter integration
* Federated AAI


#### ExPaNDS
Seminar on FAIR data


#### Jointly
Alignment of plans. 

**TODO** Realign joint Gantt chart due to extension of ExPaNDS duration (Thibaud & Thomas)
**TODO** Draft slides for done work (Thibaud & Thomas)


###  2. Dependencies on other work packages

* The training work packages rely heavily on the other work packages
* ExPaNDS has started discussions with work packages and PaNOSC has drafted a letter. We should circulate this letter so that we can get some feedback before the annual meeting and discuss that. 
* We have received a few Jupyter notebooks from WP5 that we can play around with, one for photons and one for neutrons. We can show that as an example.
* An open question is how we feed content into our portal / platform?

**TODO** Draft slides for this section (Florian)


### 3. Plans for engagement with users
* We should give an overview of existing training material and past examples of how pan-learning.org has been used. ExPaNDS will try to collect training material from partners beforehand. We already have some material in the [github repository](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/TrainingMaterials)
* We should give an update on future events, in this regard we should update the joint Gannt chart (see previous ***TODO***)

**TODO** Collect material from ExPaNDS partners (Thibaud & Nazaré) see also tasks from [previous meeting](Biweekly_2020-10-02.md)
