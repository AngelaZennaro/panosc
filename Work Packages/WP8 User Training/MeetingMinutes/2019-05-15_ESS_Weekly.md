## Actions from last meeting

### Jupyter requirement document
Jesper has initiated a spreadsheet

It was agreed that Thomas should add user requirements to the WP4, 5  & 8 joint plans that he is currently working on.

### Budget allocation for creation of videos
Thomas brought up the question at the latest PMC and Andy would have a look at it. Andy tentatively suggested that the 
available budget could be transferred to WP8. However, this is not seen as a viable solution by this meeting's participants, 
because in out opinion the budget should be used to pay professionals at the place where the videos will be recorded.

### Invitation to other WP8 participants
Thomas circulated the following email to the WP8 mailing list
```
Dear colleagues,
 
Here are some updates on the progress in WP8. We have started to have weekly WP8 meetings at ESS focusing on Task 8.1 (migration of the e-learning platform). This task only involves ESS and its secondees from University of Copenhagen and Technical University of Denmark, so therefore we have just kept it internal so far. However, if anybody from our partner facilities are interested in joining please let me know, and we will setup VC equipment so you can join. The meetings take place Wednesday from 13:00 to 14:00, i.e. right before the PMC meeting.
 
Minutes are put in the PaNOSC github repository in this folder:
https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/MeetingMinutes
 
I have also had meetings with the WP4 & 5 leaders in order to discuss MS8.1,2 (joint plans for the work packages). Everything related to this, incl. meeting summaries, are placed in this folder:
https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Work%20Packages/WP8%20User%20Training/WP4-5-8
 
In the folder you will also find a very early draft of a joint plan for Wp4, 5 & 8 that we will work on this month.
 
Cheers,
/thomas
```

### Google calendar
The new PaNOSC web site will soon be deployed. It's calendar is embedded at which point the issue will disappear.


## Other updates
A Progress report is due this month. Thomas to contribute for WP8

The completion of e-neutrons.org migration to ESS is first due beginning 2020, which potentially may clash with an update of the wiki to be completed over the summer by UCPH. UCPH should continue the update of the wiki regardless. 

Thomas had a meeting with the WP5 leader. Agreed to initially focus on integration of McStas and McXtrace followed by simex. Thomas to draft joint plan. A milestone should be added for when a decision on OASYS is made. 

The PARADISE proposal was rejected.
