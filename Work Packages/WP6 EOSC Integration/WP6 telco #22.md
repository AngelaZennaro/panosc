## Discussions:

OneData setup: The FW performance problem encountered during the initial benchmark will be fixed next week, we could expect to get the new figures before finalising the report. 
**Action 1:** Marco to perform the benchmark and feedback

All the other actions from previous minutes were already performed.




**Action 2**: Andy to inquired on the volume of data that ESRF might need to archive on UKRI.
Action performed just after the meeting: 

Jean-François and Ian explained the latest achievement with the transfer for archiving of ILL data to UKRI Object storage. As we where progressing the need of a data transfer catalog is becoming obvious ( no easy solution to question the archive on which files have been transferred). We agreed to explore rucio (https://rucio.github.io/ ) as a potential solution for such catalog and the management of replica (Rucio work on top of FTS)
**Action 3:** Ian to organise a rucio presentation for the next meeting.



AAI: a meeting is planned next Thursday to discuss the setup of UmbrellaID AAI on the PaNOSC e-learning platform .
**Action 4:** Jean-François to update the UmbrellaID  DNS record for the EduTeam Proxy, ASAP.

Use of resources: We dicussed briefly the need for WP5 resources, but the detailed requirements came after the meeting by email. Curreently investigating if EGI could answer to the request.
