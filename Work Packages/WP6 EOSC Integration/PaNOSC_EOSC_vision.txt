PaNOSC is the INFRAEOSC-04 cluster project of ESFRI Photon 
and Neutron sources. It represents a plethora of scientific
disciplines using photon and neutron sources to study
materials on a wide range of scales - from angstroms to
microns. A large user community of roughly 30000 users
annually profit from the Photon and Neutron sources in Europe
(this includes the national and ESFRI sources). 

PaNOSC sees EOSC as an opportunity to generalise the adoption
of FAIR data policies at all photon and neutron sources. 
Adopting FAIR data will enable data sharing across a wider
community and the provisioning of services for remote data
analysis. In order for these objectives to be realised the
EOSC must provide the following services: (1) a common way
of identifying, authenticating, and authorising users (AAI)
across Europe; (2) a free service for downloading data 
efficiently (distributed and high bandwidth); (3) a 
(commercial or free) solution for long term archiving
of large quantities of open data (petabytes) coupled to 
(commercial or free) high-performance storage and compute 
resources for the (re)analysis of this open data; (4) a search machine for
searching and finding scientific data in a wide variety of domains; 
(5) a catalog of (free and commercial) services for analysing
data ranging from generic services like Jupyter notebooks to
specific applications per scientific domain.

The above needs are considered the Minimum Viable Ecosystem
for the EOSC from the PaNOSC point of view. It would be 
desirable for the EOSC to become more than just a data lake. 
The EOSC should become the GitHub of Open Science in Europe! 
To achieve this it will need to provide scientists with a personal space where
they can create content (data analysis recipes, workflows, publications),
store data and share their work with collaborators via a versioning
system like GitHub.

The PaNOSC RI's would in return offer (1) petabytes of raw and processed data 
in a wide variety of scientific domains; (2) tools for generic and specific
data simulation and data analysis ; (3) recipes and expertise for reducing 
and analysing data; (4) training material for understanding photon and neutron
science.

Some of PaNOSC RIs have databases of data collected over the last 3 to 4
decades are currently under-exploited e.g. paleontology data in the
https://paleo.esrf.fr is an example of processed data which are not 
widely known or exploited yet. These data are ideal for cross disciplinary
applications and linking up with data from museums and/or other scientific
disciplines.
