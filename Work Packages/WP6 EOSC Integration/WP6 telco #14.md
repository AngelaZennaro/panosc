## Agenda:

1. Information on the current activities : AAI and Data transfer (One data, user driven data transfer solution such as Globus)
3. Validation of the KPI list (see below).
3. Report for WP6 on the annual meeting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSl5yKxHTPIE40JzUAWREkZBbg8SE_tw/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs

## Discussions:

1. #### AAI.

   Still working on the pilots (issue with the chosen OIDC plugin for confluence).

2. #### One data pilot:

   - The pilot should be ready by Christmas 
   - Test should start right after (bandwidth, how long a user will have to wait for 1GB, 10GB, 100GB of data, what are the limit)
   - Documentation in the form of recipes, in order to implement the same solution at other sites
   - Study the transfer of the analysis results to the originated RI.

3. #### KPI for WP6: 

1.  Number of service providers (i.e number of organisations) connected to UmbrellaID with eduTEAMS :
    How many of us (or external) are connected to the AAI solution to provide services
    a) Value before PaNOSC:      0 (zero)
    b) Value on Y1 of PaNOSC:   0 (zero)
    c) Target value for Y4:           10 (6 PaNOSC's RIs + 4 others)
    
2. Number of services offered that are accessible through the AAI infrastructure. Examples of services could be: searching the data catalogue, using Jupyter, using remote desktop service, etc.
    a) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
b) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    c) Target value for Y4:              20
    
3. Number of AAI (UmbrellaID with eduTEAMS ) users:
    a) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
    b) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    c) Target value for Y4:             3000 (to be defined by WP leader)

4. Number of users that have at least used one of the services provided. This should show that the services provided have an impact and 
    cover a significant part of our user communities
    a) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
    b) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    c) Target value for Y4:             3000 (to be defined by WP leader)

5. Number of partners that have set up data transfer
    This will show some progress half way through the project
    a) Value before PaNOSC:       0 (zero)
    b) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    c) Target value for Y4:            6 (All the PaNOSC's RIs)

6. Number of data sets (open and under embargo) that have been transferred (volume of data is also interesting but couldn't be a KPI) :

    a) Value before PaNOSC:       0 
    b) Value on Y1:                         0 
    c) Target value for Y4:            2000

We should be able to easily measure all of these each year (It should be part of our standard reporting for the Annual Conferences).
