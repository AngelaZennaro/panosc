## Agenda:

1. Information on the current activities : AAI and Data transfer (One data, user driven data transfer solution such as Globus)
3. Validation of the KPI list (see below).
3. Report for WP6 on the annual meeting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSl5yKxHTPIE40JzUAWREkZBbg8SE_tw/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs

## Discussions:

KPI discussed: 

1.  Service Providers connected to eduTeams Umbrella
    a) So how many of us (or external) are connected to the AAI 
    solution to provide services
    b) Value before PaNOSC:       0 (zero)
    c) Value on Y1 of PaNOSC:    0 (zero)
    d) Target value for Y4:             10 (6 PaNOSC's RIs + 4 others)
2. Services offered that are accessible through the AAI solution
    a) Examples of services could be: searching the data catalogue, 
using Jupyter, using remote desktop service, etc.
    b) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
    c) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    d) Target value for Y4:              20

3. Users that have at least used one of the services provided
    a) This should show that the services provided have an impact and 
cover a significant part of our user communities
    b) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
    c) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    d) Target value for Y4:              ?? (to be defined by WP leader)

4. Number of partners that have set up data transfer
    a) This will show some progress half way through the project
    b) Value before PaNOSC:        0 (zero)
    c) Value on Y1:                         0 (zero)
    d) Target value for Y4:              6 (the PaNOSC's RIs)

We should be able to easily measure all of these each year (that should 
be part of our standard reporting for the Annual Conferences).
