```
Action: Jean-François to raise this question to WP3/4/5.
```

#### 2.3. File transfer

File transfer solutions are core to this WP (at least needed in tasks 6.3 and 6.7). We discussed the possibilities to explore different solution for different needs FTS3, ONE DATA and  Globus Online, taking into account : the integration in the RIs infrastructure,

Needs:
- Automated transfer between data centers (including one to many)
- RIs users transfer

Functionalities:
- Integration in the RI infrastructure
- Authentication and Security aspects
- Performance
- User friendliness

We decided in the meeting to focus initially on FTS3 and Globus (ONE DATA has been reported as more challenging to implement).

FTS3 supports: http, Gridftp

It has been decided to dedicate the next meeting to the presentation of these 2 solutions.

```
Actions:
Tiziana to contact FTS3 team for having a presentation of this solution (Action done) for our next telco
Krzysztof prepare a presentation of the XFEL.EU Globus trial
```

#### 2.4. AAI 

A 2 days hands on meeting is plan at Amsterdam the 14th/15th of March, in order to discuss more carefully eduTeams with GEANT and if possible set up a pilot. Reporting should be done during the May UmbrellaID meeting that PSI is setting up.

### 3. AOB
