## Agenda:

1. Showcase datasets transfer from CERIC-ERIC to CESNET-MCC and vice versa
2. Progress on AAI implementation
3. AOB
## Discussions:

Jean-François demonstrated the work that has been done to interface eduTEAMS with keycloak (he also promised a documentation for the end of the week). Next step is to do the same with a standard shibbolteh sp (mod_shib).

Christos is presenting the work (eduTEAMS/PaNOSC) at the FIM4R meeting this week.

Giuseppe demonstrated datasets replication from OneZone from CERIC-ERIC to CESNET-MCC. The transfer took place at 150Mb/s. Marco explained that they have an network issue not specific to the OneZone solution that will be fixed ASAP, new performance tests will be achieved.

EGI would like to get Jupyter notebook, dependencies (to build the kernel) and data to complete the tests for the notebook platform. Action (Andy and all).

GEANT and EGI are working together in order to introduce UmbrellaID in the OneZone tests.

Archive pilot: initial transfer test have been achieved by Ian, ILL should now setup a CentOS machine for Thursday 27/02. ILL has inform its EPN Campus partners, with whom they share the internet access, that we are going to have more important tests transfer ( > TB) - @Ian ILL has the green light, but Jean-François needs to inform them at the start of the test.

GlobusConnect subscription: Catalin and Jean-François are planning a telco with Globus Connect next week to discuss the business model following the feedback from PaNOSC & ExPaNDS partners. The first discussion concerning security and personal data protection were positive. For those interested the public page https://docs.globus.org/security/authorization-authentication/ explain the data transfer model and which data goes through the Globus Connect servers.

EGI is looking to provide a user driven transfer solution based on FTS, Jean-François and Andy recall the need to have a user friendly and robust solution. ILL (open to other volunteers) will liaise with EGI and STFC to follow this initiative.
