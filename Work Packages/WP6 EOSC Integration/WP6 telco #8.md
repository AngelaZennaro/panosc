## Agenda:

1. General organisation
2. In order to make concrete progress and get the support from our 
   non-RI colleagues, I would like to propose that each RI describes its 
   internal infrastructure and workflow related to data management (from 
   the acquisition to the archive and access by users)
- Clarify on the RI side who is ready to engage in the technical tasks.
- I also would like to state on the ongoing recruitments and related 
difficulties if any.
