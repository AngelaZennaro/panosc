## Agenda:

1. General organisation
2. In order to make concrete progress and get the support from our 
   non-RI colleagues, I would like to propose that each RI describes its 
   internal infrastructure and workflow related to data management (from 
   the acquisition to the archive and access by users)
3. Clarify on the RI side who is ready to engage in the technical tasks.
4. I would like to state on the ongoing recruitments and related 
   difficulties if any.
## Discussions:

We discussed the Data Services architecture based on the ILL diagram.

In order to get support from all partners on how to implement the data transfer solutions proposed, each RI should present its own internal architecture.

[Use case document](DataTransferUseCases.md) for data transfer should also be completed.

CERIC should discuss internally their engagement on the different use cases. 

Most of the partners encounter delay in the recruitment of Sys Admin, EGI has proposed to help by displaying on their recruitment portal the job offers (Done for the ILL one, many thanks).
