## Agenda:

1. General organisation

    Minutes approval

    Action list

2. Discussions on the AAI integration use case for the Jupyter Notebook Service (powered by EGI).

    Data are fetched from one of the PaNOSC RIs, results of the analysis are stored back at the same RI infrastructure. EGI is handling the Compute (Jupyter) Service. Users are authenticated with the UmbrellaID AAI proxyfied by eduTeam.

    This is probably only preliminary work, but from y point of view the objectives of this discussion should be :

    - Clear understanding of the scenario by the different actors
    - How does it could work ? Identify potential solutions? Missing pieces and bottleneck to be addressed?
    - Action plan.

3. AOB
