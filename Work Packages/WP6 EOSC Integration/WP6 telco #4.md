## Agenda:

1. General organisation

    Minutes approval (unfortunately minutes of our previous meeting are not available, it has to be postponed to the next meeting)

    EOSC-Hub week: Photon - Neutron working meeting (5H00 - 6H00 PM 10th April): confirm agenda/attendance.

    Action list:

    Data transfer use cases (Initial draft)  https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP6%20EOSC%20Integration/DataTransferUseCases.md

    

2. Discussions on the AAI integration use case for the Jupyter Notebook Service (powered by EGI).

    This is one of the use case mentioned above.

    Data are fetched from one of the PaNOSC RIs, results of the analysis are stored back at the same RI infrastructure. EGI is handling the Compute (Jupyter) Service. Users are authenticated with the UmbrellaID AAI proxyfied by eduTeam.

    This is probably only preliminary work, but from my point of view the objectives of this discussion should be :

    - Clear understanding of the scenario by the different actors, complete the use case to ensure mutual understanding.
    - How could it work? Identify potential solutions. Missing pieces and bottleneck to be addressed.
    - Action plan.

3. AOB
