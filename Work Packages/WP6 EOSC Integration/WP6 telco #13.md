Report on data transfer ILL -> STFC. We have been trying transfers with GridFTP from ILL to STFC. We find the problem that we do not have compatible sets of certificates at both sites. After lots of copying certs around, we find that a CRL (certificate revocation list) related to ILL was considered out-of-date by the STFC server.
