## Agenda:

1. General organisation

2. Presentation of the Jupyter infrastructure at DESY by Michael S.
5. AOB

## Discussions:

1. Short feedback on the EduTEAMS pilot and discussions that took place during the UmbrellaID meeting at PSI. The partnership and the technical solutions presented by Christos were very well received. As some organisation representatives participating to the MoU were not present, we have to proceed to a formal adoption by email. It is expected to get the results by June.

2. Michael gave an impressive presentation of the [Infrastructure/Platform/Function]-as-a-Service set up at DESY. The presentation was followed by demonstrations of the whole solution (interactive use of Jupyter running on HPC cluster, function services triggered by filesystem events, containers creation/maintenance with gitlab, Jupyter Hub using the complete services). 

   Slides are available on the WP6 repository :
