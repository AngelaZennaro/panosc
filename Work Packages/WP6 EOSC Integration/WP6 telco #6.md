## Agenda:

1. General organisation

2. EGI notebook - data transfer guidelines (Giuseppe) 
5. AOB

## Discussions:

Few attendees to this meeting probably due to the time changed and the end of the EGI conference.

We haven't discuss the data transfer guidelines, it has to be postponed to the telco #8

We have review with the DoW of this WP, it was particularly useful for the new participants.
We have also started to discuss the next telco where Michael will present the work done at DESY on the Jupyter set up and Infrastructure.
