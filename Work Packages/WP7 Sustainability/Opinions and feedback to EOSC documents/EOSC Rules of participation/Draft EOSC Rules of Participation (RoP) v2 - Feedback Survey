Draft EOSC Rules of Participation (RoP) - Feedback Survey

Introduction 
Please provide your feedback:
Could not understand the meaning of paragraph 2: “This version (v0.2) of the RoP is a draft for discussion. It assumes that the governance structure for EOSC will include a governance framework for EOSC involving the appropriate stakeholders that includes a legal entity that will assume ownership of the RoP and provide a decision and revision process for them. This document does not, therefore, address these matters, nor does it concern itself the legal basis for EOSC“

Section A: Ground Rules 
Please provide your feedback:

Section B: Data 
Please provide your feedback:
D.1 states that “Data resources exposed through EOSC are free of charge at the point of access“. However, the business model for the EOSC has not be defined yet. It is clear that those resources are generated and curated with significant costs for our RIs, however there is no statement by any funding body (e.g. Ministries) on how will these costs be covered in the future. Moreover, if users are not necessarily registered, it is hard to understand the base for the costing.
D.2 With data producers, do we mean researchers or RIs?  Who needs to agree with The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity?  If users, this should be a fix clause in the data policy of all RIs.
D.6 The sentence “If required to do so, data users will also acknowledge the intellectual work of the original creator(s) of the data.“ is not clear from the point of view of its practical implications and may become redundant when the following one is considered. Everyone can easily comply with the first two conditions, and if any data provider needs to go beyond this, it is better they provide the standard form of reference, as indicated in the last sentence. 

Section C: Services 
Please provide your feedback:
For S1 we may object as in D1: fine to have them for free at the point of of access, as long as someone covers the costs generated by the development of the services. Note 10 touches exactly this point: the appropriateness of D1 will depend on the business model proposed. 
S2 needs to be rephrased: “…the conduct of research that assure, for example, the quality of information provided through the service for example they will not willfully misrepresent or provide false information”

Section D: Rules for EOSC Operators 
Please provide your feedback:
OP3 Monitoring and Accounting: again there is a problem with the phrasing, however monitoring and accounting need to be functional also to the cost model. Reporting to whom?  On which grounds? Will this information, or part of it, be available openly? Who will decide what will be monitored and accounted? Data and service usage is not enough.
OP6: What is the difference between a service provider and a value-add provider?

Notes 
Please provide your feedback:
1.Opennes: There may be a conflict between the openness described as “anyone can view any resource” and some of the cost models proposed in the Tinman document by the sustainability WG.
