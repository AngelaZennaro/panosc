The main points discussed during the meeting were: 

•	Feedback from WP leaders about matters requiring consultation with stakeholders
The past week, Ornela sent an email to all the Work Package leaders asking for their contribution in WP 7. In this regard we thought to prepare example questions in order to collect a more significant feedback from them (no one replied so far). These questions will be discussed during the next PMC meeting (Wednesday 18 March 2020) and if there is a significant outcome, it will be included in the deliverable D 7.1 - Photon and Neutron EOSC Stakeholder Feedback. 

•	D 7.1 - Photon and Neutron EOSC Stakeholder Feedback. 
It has been decided to remove the column with the personal information in the deliverable. The contact point will be kept in the internal stakeholders’ database and it will be used for the surveys but not published. CERIC will provide the first draft of the stakeholders’ questions divided per stakeholders’ category. 

•	Task 7.2 - Metrics and cost for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC. 
It has been decided to implement the approach in the example presented by Roberto. The costs will be divided in fixed costs and variable costs. The proposed Excel file with the list of services and associated costs will be reviewed by partners for discussion during next meeting. Once the template will be agreed, all the WP 7 members will provide information regarding the estimated costs of their Organization. This document will be kept confidential between the WP 7 members. 

•	AOB
Nothing to report.

Action list:
-	CERIC will provide the first draft of the stakeholders’ questions divided per stakeholders’ category;
-	CERIC will discuss the questions to stakeholders also with other WP leaders, during next PMC meeting;
-	CERIC will send the table with the costs metrics to WP 7 members for revision;
-	WP 7 member will make all necessary modifications to the cost approach, to be discussed during the next meeting.
-	Once agreed upon, the template will be filled with the estimated costs for every organization. This information will be kept confidential among WP7 members.
