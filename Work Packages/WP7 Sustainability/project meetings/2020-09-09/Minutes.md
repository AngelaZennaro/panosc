# PaNOSC WP 7 meeting - 09/09/2020

### Participants
Rudolf (ESRF), Ornela (CERIC-ERIC), Angela (CERIC-ERIC), Dario (CERIC-ERIC), Jean-François (ESRF), Florian (ELI), Philipe Le Brouster (ILL), Sandor Brockhauser (EuXFEL), Teodor Ivanoaica (ELI), Yury Kirienko (EuXFEL)

### Minutes

#### 1. Allocation of resources (effort) for WP7 until the end of the project 
We all agreed that it is important that every partner is represented in all the tasks of WP 7, especially in task 7.3 and 7.4. Rudolf suggests to contact Tiziana Ferrari from EGI and propose her to contribute in this WP with a minimum effort (1 or 2 persons week per task) since currently they are not involved in the WP and they could provide useful insights. Regarding the allocation by task, partners will look into the distribution and inform the WP leader if any change is necessary.

#### 2. Milestones 
The table distributed by email, with the work breakdown and the milestones was shared for comments. Everyone agrees with the proposal for the milestones and with the proposed time frame for the subtasks.  This plan will be shared with the project management (Jordi).

#### 3. Costs collection (progress, issues)
Regarding the cost collection, Rudolf and Jean-François discussed internally the template used for the cost collection and will share with the WP members an improved version in 2 or 3 days. Ornela asks Florian to take a look at the template also in view of the following subtask that will be led by ELI, the analysis of the cost drivers. There is no significant progress from the point of view of the cost collection, work is ongoing. ESRF estimates they will be able to finish in a couple of weeks, ELI in one month.
Note: the template provided by Rudolf can be found [here](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Work%20Packages/WP7%20Sustainability/Task%207.2%20Metrics%20and%20cost%20for%20the%20Photon%20and%20Neutron%20community%20EOSC)

#### 4. AOB
Next meeting will be on Wednesday 23 September 2020 from 11.00 to 12.00. 
As requested by partners, during the next meeting we will discuss about the business model, to reach a common view on the focus of the task.
