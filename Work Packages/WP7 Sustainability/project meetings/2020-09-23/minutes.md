### Participants
Rudolf (ESRF), Ornela (CERIC-ERIC), Angela (CERIC-ERIC), Dario (CERIC-ERIC), Jean-François (ESRF), Florian (ELI), Philipe Le Brouster (ILL), Sandor Brockhauser (EuXFEL), Teodor Ivanoaica (ELI), Yury Kirienko (EuXFEL)

### Minutes

#### 1. Costs collection (Feedback on the template as modified by ESRF, any other issues)
Teodor shows the result of the exercise of cost collection performed in ELI. He explains that due to the structure of the accounting and services, it is not possible to assign precise values to the service, but they would rather provide the information for aggregated services, as shown in their data sheet.
He also proposes to add some services that were missing (e.g. Distributed computing) and to change some of the current services proposed by ESRF to become more generic, for example “Tape storage” into “Tape/archive storage”. 

#### 2. Task 7.3 Business models
 Two different approaches to the business models were presented to the partnership, as possible tools to use to achieve a complete description of the business models. Both approaches are based on canvas. The first one was used by the EOSC-Pillar project to define the business model for the provision of transnational services and is being used currently by the company hired by the EOSC Secretariat (actually it was developed by this company) to propose sustainable business models for the EOSC. The second approach is the one originally proposed by Roberto in the description of the WP. Either approach may lead to the result, or a combination of both. The presentation with both approaches can be found in Github -> [Task 7.2 Metrics and cost for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC](
