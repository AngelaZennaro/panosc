 Minutes:
-----------
1.	Comments to the Rules of Participation 
PaNOSC partners will provide feedback on this document within Monday 11 May 2020. Ornela will write to the WG to know if they still accept feedback or if they are already finalizing the new version.

2.	Task 7.2 - Metrics and cost for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC
Ornela presented a document with few points based on the exchanges had so far, highlighting the main issues on which the partners should reach a common point of view before starting with the collection of costs (goal, scope, methodology). The team had a discussion. The main decisions can be summarized as follows:
•	WP7 agreed to collect the full cost of setting up and maintaining (operating) the infrastructure required for providing FAIR data
•	Costs will be collected for every single partner. 
•	More advanced infrastructures (in terms of FAIRness) will collect and report their previous investments
•	Less advanced infrastructures (in terms of FAIRness) will estimate their investments to become FAIR
•	The costs collected will include the ones for “ordinary” data management by the facilities as well as any additional cost due to the EOSC. At a later stage, these two costs components will be identified, based on rules agreed by the partners. These rules will be included in the deliverable, as part of the methodology.


This document is a living draft and the content would be included in the deliverable D 7.2. 
Not all the RIs are at the same point in producing FAIR data (FAIR maturity). To help the community to have a clear idea about what does this mean in term of costs and sustainability, PaNOSC members are working on a costs calculation exercise. The table listing the services PaNOSC partners have identified as necessary for providing FAIR data has been presented by Roberto and is open for discussion and integrations. It will be uploaded in a google doc by CERIC. The feedback from the partnership is required for the next meeting on Wednesday 20 May from 11.00 to 12.00.

ACTIONS
---------
- Prepare the comments to the Rules of Participation within Monday 11 May 2020 (All);
- Upload the table with the services list and definition for the costs calculation in a google doc (CERIC);
- Fill in the table within Wednesday 20 May (All).
