Minutes
-------

•	Status of the stakeholder database

Dario presented the status of the stakeholders’ database. He asked Jordi, Rudolf, Andy and Ornela to contribute by adding the email addresses of their contacts. Rudolf was present and he said that he will have a look into that. We need to complete this asap as this plus the survey tool are the main content of the first deliverable (month 18). The aim of this database is to provide the email addresses to which send the surveys. 

•	Selection of the survey tool

We should define the text of the survey and the tool to be used. Roberto proposed Google Form and Monkeys Survey and he explained the differences between them. We have to be compliant with the GDPR. The discussion is still open and Roberto will provide us with some proposal by the next meeting on December 2019. 

•	Open questions

The supporting material is available at this link: https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP7%20Sustainability/Supporting%20material/Supporting%20material%2004-12-2019.md. 
Rudolf added some questions: how the data will be re-usable after the embargo period? Who will take care of this? How we can calculate the costs of the open data? Jean-François said that in the next 3 years we will probably have not so much publications but in any case we should keep truck of them in order to demonstrate the added value for all the RIs in PaNOSC. He will send us a link to a video of a user that speak about the advantages of the open data for a scientist in ILL. 

•	Connection with EOSC sustainability WG 

Roberto will get touch with Rupert Lueck (first attempts were not successful). Jean-François and Rudolf suggest to contribute to the second version of the straw man document. Petra asked how can we do that and Rudolf suggested to send an email to Rupert with a concrete proposal of collaboration. Roberto will take care of this. 

•	Next telco

Nest Telco will be on Monday 16 December 2019 from 10:30 to 11
