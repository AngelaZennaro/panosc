Roberto presented an example of an auditable model costs for calculation of the PaNOSC infrastructure. Jean-Francois and Rudolf suggested to write down a list of things we should consider as inputs to the cost model in order to define a clear cost reflecting only the part that has to do with PaNOSC. Florian added that it can be useful clarified what is the scope of the intended of the WP or better. The WP text clearly defines the deliverable that will produce but there is something that goes beyond and is what we as partner we expect from this (e.g. something to show to the RI management, something to show to the EOSC governing bodies, something to present to the National governments?).
