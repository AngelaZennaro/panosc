Supporting material for meeting 04-12-2019


a) List of items we should consider as inputs to the cost model in order to define a clear cost reflecting only the part that has to do with PaNOSC:
–Infrastructure build to the sole purpose to be FAIR

•Storage

•Computing

•Networking

–Services developed to the sole purpose to be FAIR
–Cloud services costs
–People involved in the construction of the items above
–People involved in the maintenance of the items above

b) The WP text clearly defines the deliverable that will produce but there is something that goes beyond and is what we as partner we expect from this:

–Something to show to the RI management?

–Something to show to the EOSC governing bodies?

–Something to present to the National governments?

–Something different?

c) Metrics to evaluate the impact of PaNOSC have to be defined in orded to clearly measure the added value.

•OK

–Number of reuse requests to open datasets

–Number of publications coming from reused datasets

–, DOIs published, DOIs cited

•Not OK

–Number of publications

–Increase in the number of publications after PaNOSC infrastructure is in place
