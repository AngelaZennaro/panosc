Objectives
========================================================
Propose a business plan on how to sustain the data catalogs and services in the Photon and Neutron community and as part of the EOSC. In particular:
● Coordination with national or international related initiatives and support to the deployment of global and sustainable approaches in the field including coordination with EGI and the other EOSC stakeholders like RDA, the PaNdata community and LEAPS ( League of European Accelerator-based Photon Sources) initiative (https://www.leaps-initiative.eu) .
● Study - even by using advanced methodologies - of the cost per partner for maintaining the infrastructure required for providing FAIR data (archiving, data services etc.) and explore different scenarios for financing the long term costs.

Description of work
-----------------------
The work package is organised in 4 tasks most of which are connected to iterative processes that are best organized following the principles underlying the Deming cycle. The connection with the stakeholders and the collection of their feedback is a critical aspect of the work package.
Task 7.1 Stakeholders for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC (M1-M48)
(Lead: CERIC-ERIC; Participants: ESRF, ILL, XFEL.EU, ESS, ELI)
Definition of a database of stakeholders. Creation of links with the main players of the EOSC-hub, to the RDA and PaNdata community, ERF Data working group, and relevant industries in order to be able to collect input and feedback from them. The stakeholders will be involved in surveys during project execution in order to collect their important feedback. Meetings with stakeholders will be organised to facilitate interactions with the community and possibly other cluster projects in conjunction with other meetings and as part of events related to WP8 and WP9.
Task 7.2 Metrics and cost for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC (M9-M36)
(Lead: CERIC-ERIC; Participants: ESRF, ILL, XFEL.EU, ESS, ELI)
Analysis and development of metrics for the evaluation of costs and added value of the services provided to the community. This clearly depends and connects to the developed data policies and on the overall architectural choices for the Photon and Neutron community EOSC.
Task 7.3 Business models for Photon and Neutron EOSC (M13-M42)
(Lead: CERIC-ERIC; Participants: ESRF, ILL, XFEL.EU, ESS, ELI)
Development of advanced business and funding models in connection with Industrial Liaison Offices of each facility, the user communities and all the relevant industrial and research community EOSC stakeholders.
Task 7.4 Sustainability plan for the Photon and Neutron EOSC (M19-M48)
(Lead: CERIC-ERIC; Participants: ESRF, ILL, XFEL.EU, ESS, ELI)
Development of a formal long-term mission and vision for the sustainability of the PaNOSC infrastructure and software developed which will balance the viewpoints of the different stakeholder and the developed business models.
