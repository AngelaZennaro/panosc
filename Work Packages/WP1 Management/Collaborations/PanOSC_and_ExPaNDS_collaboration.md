PaNOSC and ExPaNDS collaboration
--------------------------------

The ExPaNDS and PaNOSC projects have the same objectives for a common user community. 
Both projects refer to and depend on each other to be successful.

ExPaNDS depends on a number of the outcomes of PaNOSC for their execution.

One of PaNOSC main objectives is to collaborate with the national RIs (represented by ExPaNDS).

This text proposes areas where the two projects sh/could work together. It is based
on discussions between the two project coordinators (Andy and Knut) and an analysis
of the respective WPs.
