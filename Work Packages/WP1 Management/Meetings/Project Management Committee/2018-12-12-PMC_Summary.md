1. PMC meeting role

    The role of the PMC was presented and who should attend. 
    
    Andy reminded all that the PMC is the weekly management meeting to manage the PaNOSC project and ensure the smooth running.
    He reminded all the the PMC members and WP leaders should attend. In case they cannot attend they should inform the Project
    Manager (Jordi) of their absence before the meeting. Other members of the project are welcome to attend to share progress
    of their tasks and to stay informed.
  
2. New EC Project Officer

    Andy informed that we have a new Project Officer for PaNOSC - Geert Vancraeynest.
  
    He has been invited to the Kick-off meeting. We hope to meet him then.
  
3. Consortium Agreement feedback

    Andy asked if all legal officers have a copy of the Consortium Agreement (CA) and requested them to respect the deadline
    for giving feedback by the 21/12. We would like to sign the CA before the Kick-off meeting.
    
    EGI confirmed after the meeting that they are ready to sign the CA.
    
    XFEL asked if the Open Source licence for software developed and financed by PaNOSC applies to software developed 
    as an extension of software which is not Open Source. Andy said a priori not, PaNOSC does not want to impose
    a licence on existing software.
    
    ILL could not give a date on when they could give feedback
