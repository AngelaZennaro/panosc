PaNOSC Project Management Committee meeting - 13/05/2020 
========================================================

Agenda
------	
* *Reminder : the review meeting and mid-term report were discussed during last week PMC and will be discussed again during next week PMC*
* **PLEASE NOTE : This meeting will take place through zoom:  https://esrf.zoom.us/j/333079917**

1. Slack 

   Current status:
   
   - free up to 10,000 messages. After that, the oldest cannot be retrieved.
   - we have now reached that level.
   
   Options:
   
   A. Apply for non-commercial license for Slack
   - not clear if we would get it
   
   B. Pay for commercial version of Slack
   - do we want to pay 6.25â‚¬ per user and month?*
   - active users are ~11 at the moment (52 are registered)
   - we would pay only for active users, for the period they are active
     (pro-rata), see FAQ at https://app.slack.com/plans/TK3FS2ZJA
   - Slack decides what an active user is, based on their behaviour
     - 14 days inactivity makes you inactive
     - write 2 messages does not make you active again

   C. Host an open source product (RocketChat, Mattermost) ourselves
   - could be on cloud resources
     
   D. Stick to current model 
   - accept we don't have access to older messages
     and files uploaded to Slack.
