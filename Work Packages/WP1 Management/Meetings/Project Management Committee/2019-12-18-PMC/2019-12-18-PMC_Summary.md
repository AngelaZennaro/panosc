Minutes
-------	

**1. Milestones supporting documents in GitHub + Internal Milestones supporting documents in GitHub** 

Jordi reminded everyone that there are two folders for placing the supporting documents for *Milestones* and *Internal Milestones*:
* Milestones: https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Submitted%20Milestones
* Internal Milestones: https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/tree/master/Submitted%20Internal%20Milestones

Jordi asked WP Leaders to provide the supporting documentation/evidence for the milestones and internal milestones of their Work Packages. If for some reason the information must not be public (or there is not a report) just explain the situation (who to contact to obtain the private document) or provide a link towards the location of the documentation as appropriate in the appropiate folder in GitHub.
    
**2. M18 - Deliverables + Milestones that can be advanced**

Jordi asked WP leaders to confirm whether deliverables due M18 can be advanced or not and to what date.
* Andy said that D2.1 PaNOSC data policy framework updated will be ready for end of April 2020
* Hans said that D4.2 Prototype remote desktop and Jupyter service could be ready for mid-April 2020
* Roberto was absent, but Dario will try to collect the information.

The current planning is therefore:

| Item | New date | Original Date | Comments |
| ---- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| D1.2b Mid-year Summary | end May | May 2020 | Cannot cover whole 1/2 year if submitted early |
| D2.1 PaNOSC data policy framework updated | end April 2020 | May 2020 | |
| D3.1 API definition | end May | May 2020 | |
| D4.2 Prototype remote desktop and Jupyter service | mid-April | May 2020 | | 
| D6.1 EGI data-hub integration with facilities' data repositories | mid-May | May 2020 | |
| D7.1 PaN EOSC Stakeholder Feedbacks | TBC |  |


**3. INFRAEOSC-03 & meeting 10/01/2020 in Brussels**

Andy explained that there is a call for proposals planned called INFRAEOSC 03, which could provide ~30M€ for clusters (this could mean ~3M€ per cluster). 

A discussion between clusters took place just before the meeting in Budapest and a letter was written asking cluster projects to be included in the call (with the aim to communicate and engage with scientific community leaders). This letter obtained a reply last week, saying that 
* cluster projects will be included in equality with other prosprective partners in the call, however it is still not clear what in practice the call will entitle. 
* in order to ensure that the project is manageable it is forecased that one institute could participate in the call in representation of the cluster projects (cluster projects are not a legal entity) and Andy understood that other partners of the cluster could participate as linked 3rd parties. 
* A meeting is scheduled 10th January 2020 in Brussels to further discuss and clarify INFRAEOSC 03.

After a brief discussion it was agreed that Jean-François and Rudolf will attend the meeting in Brussels and represent PaNOSC. There will be a PaNOSC Project Management Committee (PMC) meeting 15/01/2020 (the week after this meeting) and then information about the meeting and the call will be shared among all PaNOSC PMC members. Following the PMC, PaNOSC's Executive Board will be informed if the PMC agrees that PaNOSC should participate and be involved in this new call.

Andy will seek clarification about whether someone representing ExPaNDS could attend the meeting as part of the PaNOSC delegation to the meeting.

Jean-François asked wthether EGI is involved in this new call and Andy answered that yes, E-Infrastructures do participate. 
Jean-François also explained that his understanding is that the role for PaNOSC would be small, mostly about ensuring that the PaN user community is represented and that he doesn't expect PaNOSC playing a major role.

Andy explain that one of the two major points of the call is about connecting data with users, however we will know more after the meeting and once the call for proposals is published (a draft is still not available). 

It was also agreed, that if PaNOSC was to particpate in the call and be part of a proposal it will be important that not everyone participates in order to do not dilute too much the efforst between too many partners.

**4. Update from the WP Leaders - update on what has been achieved and problems**

* WP1 Management
    * Jordi explained that he has done some work on the [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iivsvBrix4v6lmC2U3sOC6YEXFeY0JzXHTM9QQQZwiY/edit#gid=0) and [Risks](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP1%20Management/Risks/PaNOSC%20Risk%20Register.xlsx). 
    * For KPIs, it is important that WP Leaders propose KPIs (if not yet done) after talking with their WP collaborators, each one with a value before PaNOSC started, a value ~M12, and a target value at the end of the project (if a target is not possible, just justify why). It was clarified that KPIs can be per partner or aggregated at cluster level depending on what is the most useful.
    * For Risks, Jordi has followed the document provided by Tiziana and will contact *risk owners* to update the file
   
* WP2 Data Policy and stewardship
    * Andy explained that a meeting took place and what is to be covered by the data policy discussed. Some types of data can be grouped and treated the same (from the policy point of view). A new type of data (auxiliary data) would help cover the topics of sofware, environment, scripts, etc. to ensure enough is known about the data and the data analysis that took place, so the data analysis can be reproduced.
    * Rudolf will ciruclate a draft Data Policy by the end of the week (22nd December).

* WP3 Data Catalogue Services
    * Tobias explained that a meeting took place last Friday, with progress being achieved in the API. They are also registering to push data into OpenAIRE.
    * A meeting is planned for 11th and 12th February in Lund with ExPaNDS (it should be possible to join remotely) and the Indico page will be available soon.
    
* WP4 Data Analysis Services
    * Hans reported the bi-weekly meetings taking place (minutes available in GitHub)
    * The prototype portal with software due to be ready for March 2020, so it can be deployed in each facility (which may be tricky)
    
* WP5 Virtual Neutron and X-Ray Laboratory (VINYL)
    * Juncheng explained that he still needs the ESRF person that is not available. Jordi explained that he managed to contact Manolo and that early January a skype call will take place. Jordi asked Juncheng to share any specific question/topic that needs to be raised with Manolo.
    * Juncheng explained that work is ongoing on defining output data formats that are directly comparable with experimental data outputs.
    * A doodle is out for a WP5 face to face meeting probably taking place in April
    * Jean-François explained that the ILL is hiring someone for WP5 and that Miguel is the contact for this
    
* WP6 EOSC Integration
    * Jean-Francois said that he is expecting feedback from CERIC-ERIC on the data transfer solution provided by EGI
    * Regarding AAI, Christos is not answering emails (most probably on leave)
    * Andy enquried about the login system and Confluence to which Jean-Francois replied that this is in Christos hands as he is contacting Confluence supplier.
    
* WP7 Sustainability
    * Roberto was absent, but Dario reported that the scheduled WP7 meeting for today was cancelled so Roberto could have a call with Rupert Lueck about sustainability.
    
* WP8 User Training
    * Thomas was absent. Petra reported a coordination meeting with ExPaNDS 10/12/2019 and a joint face to face meeting for early 2020
    * A detailed plan for Task 8.1 is also being put together
    * Petra asked whether it would be possible to get hardware for the e-learning platform (or whether we should rely on the EOSC) to which Jordi, Rudolf and Andy replied that PaNOSC has 100K€ allocated for cloud computing resources and also that EGI has 300-400K€ allocated in order to provide services, so it should be possible. Andy asked approximate requirements, in order to furhter progress on this topic.
    
* WP9 Outreach and Communication
    * Nicoletta explaiend that there is a calendar where user meetings should be placed and urged all partners to add their user meeting events.
    * Nicoletta also reminded everyone to use the google calendar to place their PaNOSC planned meetings.
    * Nicoletta also explained tha SSHOC cluster project is organising a meeting 8th January to talk about joint actions for cluster communication and user engagement.
    * Nicoletta also reported ongoing work on the DOI video, news and interviews
    * Andy explained that a a mailing list is being set up t oshare info among the 35 projects participating in INFRAEOSC calls. Andy will ensure that Nicoletta can be a member of this mailing list.
