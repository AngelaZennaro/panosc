Minutes
-------

1. **Annual Meeting in Trieste**

Rudolf said that he would like to advance as much as possible in the agenda for the annual conference, the speakers and list of people
to invite in order to avoid having to rush in September
Nicoleta explained that Dario is on leave until the beginning of August.
There was agreement on the 4th and 5th November dates for the annual conference, however still there isn't a clear idea on whether 
there will be some events in the following days (for WP work or working with other cluster projects).
Jordi will create a google doc **(link here)** so everyone can collaborate on the list of invitees. Initial suggestions for whom to 
invite were representatives of:
* FAIRsFAIR
* EOSC-Hub
* EOSC Board
* OpenAIR
* EUdat
* Geant
* User representatives (Andy pointed out that users from CERIC-ERIC may be easier to obtain)

Florian also said that it would be nice if some social activity would take place during the annual conference

2. **Internal new milestones/deliverables suggestion**

Andy shared the partial list of proposed internal milestones **(see issue [#43](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/issues/43))** which was briefly discussed.
Tobias said that WP3 will be in a position to provide a list of internal milestones by 19th September
It was then agreed that Jordi will email each WP leader to ask them to talk internally within their WP about milestones that are
useful to follow-up work and that these must be ready by 19th September. The final list of collected milestones will be then used
by WP1 to control progress on the project and each individual WP.
Jean-Francois pointed out that it that to start it would be good if representatives from each partners will be participating 
in all WP meetings.

**OFF-TOPIC** : 
* Andy wanted to share news about our new Project Officer: Rene Martins, who has already been invited to our
annual conference.
* Andy also raised the point about the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between PaNOSC and ExPaNDS. There was broad
agreement that this document does not need to be legally binding and we may not even have to sign it as it is just a declaration
of intentions to cooperate. By not signing the document we do not need to answer difficult questions about who signs, with 
what authority, what are the impacts, etc. In any case Florian recommended to add to the document that everything would be 
done in a best-efforts basis. Nicoletta also asked about communications about the MoU. Florian answer that there is no 
need to change past news/content about the MoU.
    
3. Update from WP Leaders
    * WP1 Management: Jordi reported that he was on leave and we already talked about MoU. Jordi verified internally that 
    effort in order to produce the Financial Report seems management and will remind all partner institutions that this is 
    coming up. The plan is to explain what we must collate at the end of August, remind of the reporting period (01/12/2018 -
    31/08/2019) and the deadline to provide the information (30/09/2019).
    
    * WP2 Data Policy and Stewardship: Andy was also on leave recently. He reported on information shared by Nicoletta about a
    [FAIRsFAIR Open Call for Data Repositories](https://www.fairsfair.eu/fairsfair-open-call-data-repositories) to make them
    more FAIR.  The deadline to participate on this initiative is 30th August.
    
    * WP3 Data Catalog Services: Tobias reported kick-off meeting of the WP taking place and that progress has started on the 
    search API and looking at NeXUS files to harmonise metadata catalogues.
    
    * WP4 Data Analysis Services: Hans was absent. No news.
    
    * WP5 Virtual Neutron and X-ray Laboratory: Carsten was absent. No news.
    
    * WP6 EOSC Integration: Jean-Francois reported two activities: AAI with Geant (this is waiting for a vote at PSI) and a 
    meeting in Amsterdam (very technical, with three solutions presented that we want to pilot). Andy asked about data transfer
    to which Jean-Francois answered that there are no news (for now only Globus online)
    
    * WP7 Sustainability: Roberto reported a WP7 meeting that took place today about the cost model. CERIC will propose
    something and check it with their financial advisor before circulating it at the beginning of september.
    
    * WP8 Staff training in data stewardship: Thomas was excused. No news.
    
    * WP9 Outreach and Communication: Nicoletta reported work updating the website and contacting WP leaders for content. She
    also expalined the EOSC Secretariat intiative for a video with testimonials from projects (we have 4 candidates for this 
    so far). Andy thanked Nicoletta for the changes in the website server as it is much better now.
 
**WE RAN OUT OF TIME** for the [issues](https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/issues), however there are two things to note:
* ExPaNDS Kick-off meeting: taking place at DESY, in Hamburg on 11-12 September. Registrations [here](https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/23649/registration/)
* EOSC Working Group: Jean-Francois asked whether we want to participate in that as in the meeting in Turin we were invited
to join and submit a position paper. Jean-Francois thinks that it is a bit early for us to do this.
Andy pointed out that we must nevertheless check the reports, as sometimes it is reported that *cluster projects want*, *the
cluster projects point of view is* when we are not consulted.
