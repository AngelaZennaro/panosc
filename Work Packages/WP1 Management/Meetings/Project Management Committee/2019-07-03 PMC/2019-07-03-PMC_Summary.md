PaNOSC Project Management Committee meeting - 03/07/2019
========================================================
The meeting was finally canceled because several participants were unavailable. 
However, some written feedback was received on some of the agenda items:

1. Annual Meeting in Trieste - Change of date
Dario confirms the availability of the Savoia Hotel for the 4th and 5th of November and the reservation is confirmed. 
These dates are now confirmed and shall be communicated to all the involved parties. 
The Executive Board meeting will thus take place on the 5th in the afternoon. Only Mark Johnsson (ILL) signalled that he
would not be available on that date.

2. Internal new milestones/deliverables
Action:
Aders are requested to make proposals for the *next* PMC meeting for new milestones which would allow better
monitoring of progress.
