PaNOSC Project Management Committee meeting - 03/07/2019
========================================================
The meeting was finally canceled because several participants were unavailable. 
However, some written feedback was received on some of the agenda items:

1. Annual Meeting in Trieste - Change of date
Dario confirms the availability of the Savoia Hotel for the 4th and 5th of November and the reservation is confirmed. 
These dates are now confirmed and shall be communicated to all the involved parties. 
The Executive Board meeting will thus take place on the 5th in the afternoon. Only Mark Johnsson (ILL) signalled that he
would not be available on that date.

2. Internal new milestones/deliverables
Action:
All work package leaders are requested to make proposals for the *next* PMC meeting for new milestones which would allow better
monitoring of progress. 

3. Update from the WP leaders

* WP4 - Data Analysis Services. They had their workshop last week with 30 participants. The have collectively taken my notes, reflecting on ideas and
identified aread of joined interest. They plan to process and extract those in the coming weeks and month 10 internal milestones
and responsibilites. There was good participation from ExPaNDS/DESY (Knut, Anton Barty, Patrick Fuhrmann, Frank Schluenzen).
Feedback from participants attending the workshop was generally positive.

* WP6 - EOSC integration. Concerning authentication we are waiting for the results of the UmbrellaID management team vote (expected for the 4th of July).
The last telco was not well attended (ELI attended, CERIC was excused all the other RIs were absent), 
the lack of engagement on the RI side is more and more a concern for WP6. The WP leader will be away in August, but
if nothing changes in September he will propose to discuss this issue seriously at the PM level 
(making clear who is really willing to actively work on what).

* WP7 - Sustainability. The minutes of the first WP7 meeting (19/06/19) are now available on GitHub. (https://github.com/panosc-eu/panosc/blob/master/Work%20Packages/WP7%20Sustainability/project%20meetings/2019-06-19/minutes.md)
